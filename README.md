# UPSat Structural

Hardware for UPSat communications subsystem and for the antenna deployment mechanism. This repository includes all needed.

## Documentation


## Repository policy
UPSat hardware repositories only track source design files. All needed derivative files (e.g. stl, grb etc) for production are created per release, packaged in an archive and uploaded linked to a  [release](*link needed*).

Each major release (x.0.0) is branched out of master. Subsequent fixes (minor or not) are commited on those branches and tagged accordingly.

Master branch is most times under active development, so expect things to break. For production ready and previous releases source files check tags and branches.
